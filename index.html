    <h1> About Me! </h1>
    <img id = "me" src= "library/me.png">  </img>
<p id = "bio"> Hello, my name is Shivani Ramdeo. I am 15 years old and attend Thomas A. Edison CTE high school. I am a dancer of Sanasani Dance Group. I have been dancing since I was 3 years old, but have only been a part of Sanasani for almost 6 years! Sanasani has been my favorite dance group as it's not just a dance class, it's a second family. We don't only dance, but we also go on vacation together and always plan hangouts when we have time. Every summer we have a beach day, pool day, waterpark day, concerts, amusement park day and a camping weekend. Every year we have our annual parties where we celebrate Cinco de Mayo, Christmas, Birthdays, and Thanksgiving. We act as though we've known each other our whole lives and are inseparable. We always say that God didn't make us actual siblings because we would be too much for our parents to handle under one roof. </p>
